My name is Dian Jiao, and I am a fourth-year PhD student in Accounting at Columbia Business School. I am broadly interested in how accounting information shapes market efficiency. My current research examines how the information is strategically communicated by corporations and manifested by financial institutions. In my research, I apply both empirical and analytical methods.

Prior to joining CBS, I had served for two years as a quantitative researcher at  <a href="https://www.ruitiancapital.com/">Ruitian Capital</a>, focusing on systematic equity strategies based on statistical methods. I received an M.Phil in Accounting and an M.S. in Financial Engineering from <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>, and an M.A. in Finance and a B.S. in Applied Math from <a href="https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>. 

Born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henan">Henan Province</a>, the birthplace of Chinese Civilization with over 3,200 years of recorded history, I enjoy history, poems, and Chinese calligraphy. Also, I am interested in bouldering, basketball, table tennis, road cycling, swimming, and hiking.
