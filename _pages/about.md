*Lecturer @ School of Math & Stats, UNSW Sydney*

**Email: ruyi.liu2@unsw.edu.au**

I am a Lecturer in Financial Mathematics at the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.unsw.edu.au/science/our-schools/maths) at [UNSW, Sydney](https://www.unsw.edu.au/). 

**My research interests:**
- Stochastic Control (Game)
- (Backward) Stochastic Differential Equations
- and their Applications in real-world markets

My research revolves around stochastic control, (backward) stochastic differential equations, and their applications in practical markets (e.g. financial, commodities and the electricity). I have investigated optimal stopping/control problems and the financial derivatives pricing in the context of financial/hazard risks. Additionally, I have studied the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of certain classes of BSDEs and FBSDEs that arise in optimal control/stopping problems.


**If you have any questions regarding my research or want to collaborate feel free to contact me anytime. I am looking for highly motivated students, feel free to drop me an email with your CV.**
