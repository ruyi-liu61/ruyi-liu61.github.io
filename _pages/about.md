*Lecturer, Math & Stats School, UNSW Sydney*

I am a Lecturer in Financial Mathematics at the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.unsw.edu.au/science/our-schools/maths) at [UNSW, Sydney](https://www.unsw.edu.au/). 

**My research interests:**
- Stochastic Control (Game)
- (Backward) Stochastic Differential Equations
- and their Applications in financial and electricity markets

My research revolves around uncertainty quantification, probabilistic modeling, and its applications in the natural sciences. I have a strong interest in the theoretical foundations of such methods, as well as in their practical applications. Furthermore, I am interested in developing novel probabilistic or uncertainty quantification-related methods for neural networks. Applications of the developed methods include [meteorology](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/aies/aop/AIES-D-24-0049.1/AIES-D-24-0049.1.xml), [dynamical systems](https://openreview.net/forum?id=gangoPXSRw), [energy systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666546823000113) or quantum physics.


Before the start of my PhD I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering and a Masters's degree in Mathematics from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

**If you have any questions regarding my research or want to collaborate feel free to contact me anytime**.

My name is Ruyi Liu (刘如一), and I am a Lecturer in Financial Mathematics at the School of Mathematics and Statistics. My research focuses on stochastic control (game), (backward) stochastic differential equations, and their applications in the financial and electricity markets.


Prior to joining CBS, I had served for two years as a quantitative researcher at  <a href="https://www.ruitiancapital.com/">Ruitian Capital</a>, focusing on systematic equity strategies based on statistical methods. I received an M.Phil in Accounting and an M.S. in Financial Engineering from <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>, and an M.A. in Finance and a B.S. in Applied Math from <a href="https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>.
