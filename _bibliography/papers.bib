  abstract = {We study the upper and lower bounds for prices of European and American style options with the possibility of an external termination, meaning that the contract may be terminated at some random time. Under the assumption that the underlying market model is incomplete and frictionless, we obtain duality results linking the upper price of a vulnerable European option with the price of an American option whose exercise times are constrained to times at which the external termination can happen with a non-zero probability. Similarly, the upper and lower prices for an vulnerable American option are linked to the price of an American option and a game option, respectively. In particular, the minimizer of the game option is only allowed to stop at times which the external termination may occur with a non-zero probability.},

  abstract = {The main focus of this paper is to identify the most effective selling strategy for pairs trading of stocks. In pairs trading, a long position is held in one stock meanwhile a short position is held in another. The goal is to determine the optimal time to sell the long position and repurchase the short position in order to close the pair position. The paper presents an optimal pairs-trading selling rule with trading constraints. In particular, the underlying stock prices evolve according to a two-dimensional geometric Brownian motion and the trading permission process is given in terms of a two-state {trading allowed, trading not allowed} Markov chain. It is shown that the optimal policy can be determined by a threshold curve which is obtained by solving the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations (quasi-variational inequalities). A closed-form solution is obtained. A verification theorem is provided. Numerical experiments are also reported to demonstrate the optimal policies and value functions.},
