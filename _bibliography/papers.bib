  abstract = {We study the upper and lower bounds for prices of European and American style options with the possibility of an external termination, meaning that the contract may be terminated at some random time. Under the assumption that the underlying market model is incomplete and frictionless, we obtain duality results linking the upper price of a vulnerable European option with the price of an American option whose exercise times are constrained to times at which the external termination can happen with a non-zero probability. Similarly, the upper and lower prices for an vulnerable American option are linked to the price of an American option and a game option, respectively. In particular, the minimizer of the game option is only allowed to stop at times which the external termination may occur with a non-zero probability.},

  abstract = {The main focus of this paper is to identify the most effective selling strategy for pairs trading of stocks. In pairs trading, a long position is held in one stock meanwhile a short position is held in another. The goal is to determine the optimal time to sell the long position and repurchase the short position in order to close the pair position. The paper presents an optimal pairs-trading selling rule with trading constraints. In particular, the underlying stock prices evolve according to a two-dimensional geometric Brownian motion and the trading permission process is given in terms of a two-state {trading allowed, trading not allowed} Markov chain. It is shown that the optimal policy can be determined by a threshold curve which is obtained by solving the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations (quasi-variational inequalities). A closed-form solution is obtained. A verification theorem is provided. Numerical experiments are also reported to demonstrate the optimal policies and value functions.},

  abstract = {The participation of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) in the spot market enhances the flexibility of modern power systems as renewable energy penetration increases. However, multiple uncertainties on the market, load, and generation sides can significantly affect the bidding strategies and operational efficiency of VPPs. This paper employs interval numbers generated by a data-driven model to capture the uncertainty and correlation of electricity prices in the spot market. Additionally, uncertainty sets are utilized to represent the variability in the number of electric vehicles (EVs) and photovoltaic (PV) power generation. A two-stage interval robust optimization model considering arbitrage opportunity is established to optimize the bidding strategies of a VPP that includes gas turbines, energy storage, PV systems, and EVs. An improved column-and-constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm is developed to solve this model.
The results demonstrate that the interval numbers of electricity prices produced by the proposed data-driven model can reduce VPP cost fluctuations by 9.3%. The two-stage interval robust optimization model reduces costs by 2.5% compared to a single-stage robust method and 52.0% compared to robust method ignoring arbitrage opportunities. As parameters change, the advantages of the proposed model become more significant. The improved C&CG algorithm shows superior convergence and accuracy. Unlike stochastic optimization methods that generate 
 scenarios, the computational time for the interval optimization method can be reduced to. This study offers a feasible solution for the bidding strategies of VPPs considering multiple uncertainties in the spot market.},

  abstract = {A novel type of an investment insurance product for holders of superannuation accounts in Australia, tentatively named an Equity Protection Swap (EPS), is proposed and examined. An EPS shares some features with the variable annuity known as the registered index-linked annuity (RILA) but it is a standalone financial derivative, which makes it appropriate as a protection tool against downside risk for holders of superannuation accounts. Its basic forms, dubbed buffer and floor EPSs, offer a partial protection against losses on a reference portfolio below a predetermined threshold in exchange for a share of portfolio's gains if the realised return on a reference portfolio is above a predetermined level. Model-free explicit pricing formula for a generic EPS is obtained by considering its static hedging by a portfolio of European options. As opposed to classical insurance products, the structure of an EPS allows for the fair initial premium to be null through a judicious selection of the provider's participation rate in portfolio's gains. A theoretical study of forward performance of EPSs based on the cross-currency market model and an empirical cost/benefit analysis based on market data for S&P 500 and S&P/ASX 200 indices demonstrate tangible benefits of EPSs as an efficient investment insurance tool for superannuation accounts.

  abstract = {Pairs trading is about simultaneously trading a pair of stocks. A pairs trade is triggered when their prices diverge and consists of a short position of the strong stock and a long position of the weak one. Pairs trading bets on the reversal of their price strengths. In this paper, we study the optimal pairs-trading problem under general geometric Brownian motions and focus on trading with cutting losses. The objective is to trade the pairs over time to maximize an overall return with a fixed transaction cost. Our optimal policy is characterized by threshold curves obtained by solving the associated HJB equations. We provide sufficient conditions that guarantee the optimality of our trading rules. We also present numerical examples to illustrate.

The goal of this work is twofold. First, we aim to establish the well-posedness results and comparison theorems for a generalized BSDE and a reflected generalized BSDE with a continuous and nondecreasing driver 
. Second, we study penalization schemes for a generalized BSDE and a reflected generalized BSDE in which we penalize against the driver in order to obtain in the limit either a constrained optimal stopping problem or a constrained Dynkin game in which the set of minimizerâ€™s admissible exercise times is constrained to the right support of the measure generated by A

  abstract = {This paper considers a continuous-time mean-variance portfolio selection with regime-switching and random horizon. Unlike previous works, the dynamic of assets are described by non-Markovian regime-switching models in the sense that all the market parameters are predictable with respect to the filtration generated jointly by Markov chain and Brownian motion. The Markov chain is assumed to be independent of Brownian motion, thus the market is incomplete. The authors formulate this problem as a constrained stochastic linear-quadratic optimal control problem. The authors derive closed-form expressions for both the optimal portfolios and the efficient frontier. All the results are different from those in the problem with fixed time horizon.
