  abstract = {We investigate a leader-follower game in which the leader hires the follower to complete a project with the presence of a random shock time. If the project is completed before the shock time, then both players receive (up to discounting) $1 each. If it is completed after the shock time, then the leader and the follower receive $y and $x respectively. The shock time is observable by the leader, but not by the follower. The leader chooses how to reveal the information of the shock time, and the follower controls the effort level which affects the project completion time. The goal is to find the leader's value and optimal information disclosure strategy. By considering the leader's value as a function of the follower's utility as well as the follower's belief about the shock time, we characterize the leader's value using dynamic programming equations. The leader's (Îµ-)optimal strategy can also be constructed from these equations.}

  abstract = {The financial industry has undergone a significant transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to Risk Free Rates (RFR) such as, e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in the U.S. and the AUD Overnight Index Average (AONIA) in Australia, as the primary benchmark rate for borrowing costs. The paper examines the pricing and hedging method for SOFR-related financial products in a cross-currency context with the special emphasis on the Compound SOFR vs Average AONIA cross-currency basis swaps. While the SOFR and AONIA serve as a particular case of a cross-currency basis swap (CCBS), the approach developed is able to handle backward-looking term rates for any two currencies. We give explicit pricing and hedging results for collateralized cross-currency basis swaps using interest rate and currency futures contracts as hedging tools within an arbitrage-free multi-curve setting.}
