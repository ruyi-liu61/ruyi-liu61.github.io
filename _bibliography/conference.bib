  abstract = {High-dimensional structure and composition spaces present a major challenge in materials discovery due to the difficulty of efficiently navigating vast and complex design space. Additionally, most existing machine learning approaches lack the capability to quantify epistemic uncertainty, which arises from limited data, a critical limitation for materials discovery tasks involving high-dimensional representations such as atomic structures. To address these challenges, we introduce UPNet, an uncertainty-aware atomistic machine learning model within a Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework. UPNet enables automated representation learning directly from high-dimensional atomic structures while providing principled uncertainty quantification through the use of Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Process (SNGP). By incorporating a constrained expected improvement acquisition function, our BO framework optimizes multiple evaluation criteria simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in catalyst discovery for the CO₂ reduction reaction. The results show that the UPNet model archives high prediction accuracy. The model can also extract interpretable latent features due to its ability to preserve the similarities of the materials structures from the input space to the latent space. The developed constrained BO method outperforms unconstrained BO and random search in terms of the quantity and quality of the discovered materials with top performance. Our method reduces computational cost and time, achieving a 10× reduction in the number of required simulation calculations. Beyond catalysis, this framework offers a broadly applicable solution for accelerating materials discovery in various domains that involve high-dimensional design inputs and expensive physics-based simulations.}

  abstract = {Various faults can cause electric machine failures, causing downtime and asset losses. Fault detection technologies are highly desirable in the industry to predict and prevent such failures. Recent advances in machine learning have enabled data- driven models that identify faults from signals monitored in the motors. However, those signals could be complex and the features that indicate faults are subtle. Therefore, effective methods for extracting informative features relevant to faults from signals are desired. In this paper, we explore the use of contrastive learning in the detection of bearing faults from phase current signals. We develop a model architecture consisting of two parts, a feature extractor and a classifier, where the feature extractor is pre-trained using supervised contrastive learning. Tested on the Paderborn University bearing fault dataset, our model attains a high fault classification accuracy of 87%, which outperforms the conventional machine learning models. We also perform ablation tests to demonstrate the importance of contrastive learning- based training in this model. By investigating the classification results and extracted features of the models, we further verify the effectiveness of contrastive learning in extracting features that distinguish different classes. We anticipate that contrastive learning can lay the foundation of more accurate fault detection models and be extended to other practical fault detection tasks.}
